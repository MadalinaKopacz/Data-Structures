In this project, I implemented 6 sorting algorithms: 
- Optimized Bubble Sort;
- Counting Sort;
- Radix Sort in base 16 and 256;
- Merge Sort;
- In-Place Merge Sort;
- Quick Sort.

The algorithm chooses random values for each test and shows the execution time of each sorting algorithm to be compared with the others, including STL Sort.
Moreover, in Sorting Algorithms - Descriptions and Comparisons, I presented some informations and differences between the implemented algorithms.
